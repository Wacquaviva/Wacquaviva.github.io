                    The project goal is to create an electro-mechanical smart organizer in which a user can place an item on a pad scanner that can identify the item by type and size, and then the toolbox will organize itself using a robotic-like mechanism. I utilized CAD modeling to analyze different design concepts and participated in the overall process from requirements to final fabrication and testing.

                    My product is a representation of the life after death of sunken boats. In my coastal town, fishing has a huge market, and many go on boats for enjoyment as well. Due to this, accidents happen and sometimes, boats sink, or more commonly crash. While this marks the death of the boat, it also marks the beginning of a new habitat for wildlife including fish and plants at the sea floor. To represent this, I made a flower vase consisting of 2 halves of a boat, a base, and a lobster trap buoy. I will incorporate Natural elements by filling the base with sand, using real rocks to create a fake Jetty in the center, and including shells and sea life that can survive and provide nutrients for the plants, prolonging the life of the flowers held inside the vase.

                    Developed a software solution using Python to enable real-time interactions between TikTokLive and other clients through multiple APIs. The platform allows users to engage via live chat, triggering features like text-to-speech, in-game enemy spawning, and real-life light effects. This project enhanced my skills in Python programming, API integration, software development, and problem-solving, while also providing experience in managing complex projects and negotiating service value.
