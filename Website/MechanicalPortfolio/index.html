                    The project goal is to create an electro-mechanical smart organizer in which a user can place an item on a pad scanner that can identify
                    the item by type and size, and then the toolbox will organize itself using a robotic-like mechanism. In addition to participating in the overall
                    process from requirement setting to final fabrication and test, I utilized CAD modeling to analyze different design concepts.

                    Engaged in the RoboJackets club at Georgia Tech, specifically as part of the Three Pound Battle Bots team. Collaborating with a team of
                10, we design, manufacture, and operate a functional RC robot aimed at competing with other three-pound robots from Georgia Tech
                    beyond. Have further developed skills to work with a team on a complex technical project to achieve a goal while staying within
                design restraints. Have incorporated knowledge of material science and kinematics to produce a robust, light-weight, effective robot.
