                    <p>During my freshman year at Georgia Tech, I opted into an extra project for my ME 1670 class where I had the unique opportunity to design and build prototypes for a senior capstone team. The project goal was to create an electromechanical smart organizer that could identify items placed on a pad scanner by type and size, then automatically sort them using a robotic mechanism. This hands-on experience allowed me to contribute to a real-world engineering challenge, from the initial design concepts all the way to final fabrication and testing.
                    <br>
                    <p>This project taught me the foundational elements of engineering design and development. I learned to use SolidWorks for CAD modeling to analyze and refine different design concepts, ensuring they were both functional and feasible. I was quickly introduced to the importance of an iterative design process, as I participated in many design reviews with the senior team. This taught me how to effectively implement feedback and make rapid improvements. I also gained practical skills in working with both 3D-printed and machined components during the prototyping phase, and learned to integrate mechanical systems with electronic controls.</p>

                    <p>As part of Georgia Tech’s RoboJackets 3 lb BattleBots team, my teammates and I set out with a singular goal: to design, manufacture, and pilot a combat robot to compete in its weight class. The challenge went beyond simply building a robot, it was about engineering a machine resilient enough to withstand punishing hits in the arena, or, if it failed, to be quickly repaired and returned to battle. This required anticipating weak points, planning for inevitable breakdowns, and designing with repairability in mind. Having grown up watching BattleBots, getting the chance to build and compete with one of my own was an incredible, full-circle experience.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Took on the challenge of designing the robot’s main shell, applying principles of material science and kinematics to create a structure that was both lightweight and robust. Selected materials with the best strength-to-weight ratio for the armor and chassis, and designed and manufactured two adjacent steel teeth mounted to the shell. The shell was 3D-printed at a 45° angle to maximize strength against high-impact shear forces from collisions with the steel teeth. Additionally, worked on optimizing the robot’s center of gravity and developing the main drivetrain system to ensure stable handling, efficient power transfer, and reliable performance. Every component, from the drivetrain to the weapon mechanism, was carefully optimized to balance budget, weight, and performance.</p>

                        <li>Leveraged material science and 3D-printing to create a replaceable, $15, 115 oz robot shell tailored to budget constraints</li>
                        <li>Designed and manufactured two adjacent steel teeth mounted to the shell to maximize kinetic energy transfer and concentrate impact forces</li>
                        <li>Ensured adherence to strict center of gravity requirements for a shell-spinning weapon with central axis rotation</li>

                    <p>I learned how to utilize CATIA, utilizing the powerful CAD software to work within a larger system for managing complex assemblies and parts. I took an internal club course to learn the system's structure and the importance of Product Data Management (PDM), which allowed me to understand how all the individual components of a large system are managed and controlled. This practical experience gave me insight into how professional engineering teams use an integrated platform to ensure configuration control and streamline the design workflow for a large-scale project. I also collaborated closely with team members who had been on the project longer, participating in technical handovers and absorbing critical design information and best practices.</p>

                    <p>In my coastal town, fishing is a huge industry and a popular pastime. But with so many boats on the water, accidents are bound to happen. While a sunken boat may be a tragedy, it also marks a new beginning for marine life. The wreckage can become a new habitat for fish and plants, and in that way, the boat is reborn as a thriving ecosystem on the seafloor.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I created a flower vase to represent this cycle of life and death. The piece consists of two halves of a boat, a base, and a lobster trap buoy. I incorporated natural elements to create a miniature coastal environment: I filled the base with sand, added real rocks to create a jetty, and included shells and marine life that could provide nutrients for the flowers inside the vase. The final product was a symbolic representation of the beauty that can emerge from a tragedy and the resilience of nature to flourish even in the most unlikely of places.</p>

                    <p>As an intern with the Patriot Missile Team at Raytheon (RTX), I redesigned a critical sub-assembly, moving the project from concept to a manufactured prototype. I was responsible for the design and manufacturing of a new circuit card assembly (CCA), which included performing a 30-part tolerance stack-up to guarantee a perfect fit within its system. Through collaboration with manufacturing engineers, I also led Design for Manufacturing (DFM) reviews to ensure the new design could be installed with ease. My work extended beyond this single component, as I also calculated the major assembly's center of gravity to ensure optimal mass distribution and collaborated on technical markups for new drawings on other systems.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This experience was a masterclass in the complexities of real-world engineering. I learned to leverage industry-standard software like Creo Parametric for design and Windchill PDM for managing all product data and engineering changes. I was also introduced to Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to predict part performance. I quickly learned the importance of a structured workflow, from rapid prototyping to formal design reviews, ensuring all design choices adhered to established best practices. This required strong interdisciplinary teamwork, as I worked with manufacturing, quality, and systems engineers to deliver a robust and reliable product. Ultimately, this internship provided me with invaluable insight into how an effective design process, coupled with collaboration and technical rigor, can solve complex engineering challenges.</p>

                    <p>I implemented a core feature for license plate lookups by integrating a third-party DMV API with end-to-end data encryption.

                    <p>For the final project of the ME 2110: Creative Decisions and Design course at Georgia Tech, my team and I designed and constructed a robot for the "Inside Out 2" competition. The robot was engineered to autonomously score points by completing three distinct tasks within a 40-second time limit: collecting small objects ("emotions"), depositing "mind manuals" into a rotating carousel, and lifting a character ("Sadness") four feet into the air. This project was a comprehensive exercise in mechatronics, integrating mechanical design, electronics, and programming to solve a complex problem. In the final competition, our innovative and resource-efficient machine earned our team 2nd Place in the overall Design Review.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My primary responsibilities focused on the mechanical design and fabrication of several key subsystems. I played a significant role in developing the telescoping lift used to raise "Sadness." This mechanism consisted of four nested aluminum T-slots extended by a string-and-spool system powered by a large DC motor, allowing it to be both lightweight and strong. I also helped design the main deployment platform, which used a single pneumatic actuator and drawer slides to initiate two other tasks simultaneously. This launch action caused a sweeping arm to collect the "emotions" and extended a launcher that used the kinetic energy from the moving game field to dispense the "mind manuals," showcasing an efficient and integrated design.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Beyond the initial design phase, I was heavily involved in the robot's construction and testing. This project gave me extensive hands-on experience with fabrication techniques like 3D printing and working with various raw materials. Throughout this process, I refined my skills in mechanical design, system integration, and rapid prototyping. The experience taught me the critical importance of designing for reliability and consistency, and it significantly improved my ability to take a complex concept from an idea to a functional, competition-ready machine.</p>
